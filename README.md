# DotNet7-Rpg-MinimalApi

A small project to help improve my knowledge of dotnet api construction. 
Essentially expanding upon the Rest API built during Patrick God's ".NET 7 Web API & Entity Framework Jumpstart" Udemy course.

Attempting to focus upon clean architecture, CQRS, and use the minimal API.

If you like seeing someone fumble around and committing shoddy code, followed by great code (probably not mine), followed by messing up the great code trying to reinvent the wheel you'll love this.
